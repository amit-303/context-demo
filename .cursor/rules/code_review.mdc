# Code Review: React To-Do App

## 1. Functional & Technical Requirements
- The code must align with the product goals and scope defined in the `PRD.md`[cite: 1, 21].
- The implementation should follow the component design and state management guidance provided in `implementation.md`[cite: 2, 21].
- All data must be stored in the browser's `localStorage`[cite: 4, 21]. [cite_start]The code must not use a backend or external database[cite: 4].
- Ensure `localStorage` read/write operations use safe patterns, such as `try/catch` blocks, to prevent application crashes[cite: 5, 6].
- Verify that the core features—add, edit, toggle complete, delete, filtering, and persistence—are implemented and functional[cite: 8].

## 2. Code Quality & Style
- The code must use React functional components and hooks[cite: 9, 19].
- State should be managed immutably, and the code should avoid direct mutation[cite: 10, 20].
- Variable and function names must use `camelCase`, and component names must use `PascalCase`[cite: 19].
- Code should be clean, modular, and well-commented, but only where necessary[cite: 10, 16].
- All generated Markdown should use clear headings and bullet points[cite: 17, 22].

## 3. Documentation & UI/UX
- Generated documentation and code should not duplicate information from `PRD.md` or `ui_ux.md`[cite: 2, 3, 11].
- The UI and interactions should be consistent with the design guidelines in `ui_ux.md`[cite: 3].
- All generated Markdown files must be formatted using clear headings, bullet points, and a concise, consistent tone[cite: 22].

## 4. Testing & Bug Handling
- The code must include basic automated unit tests that cover main user flows and `localStorage` persistence[cite: 13].
- Tests should cover common bug scenarios mentioned in `bug_tracking.md`, such as empty input, duplicate IDs, and `localStorage` errors[cite: 14].
- Check for notes or comments that indicate where manual review or refinement might be needed[cite: 15].
