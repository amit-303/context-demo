- Format all generated Markdown with clear headings and bullet points.
- Use concise, consistent tone across docs and comments.
- Use functional React components with hooks.
- Use **camelCase** for variables/functions and **PascalCase** for component names (e.g., `TodoItem`, `TodoList`).
- Manage state **immutably** and use safe update patterns (no direct mutation).
- Reference and align with project docs: `PRD.md`, `implementation.md`, `ui_ux.md`, and `bug_tracking.md`.
- Format all generated Markdown files using clear **headings**, **bullet points**, and a **concise, consistent tone**.
- Avoid duplicating information already documented; focus on minimal, working, testable output.
