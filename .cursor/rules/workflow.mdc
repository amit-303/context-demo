- Reference and align with project docs: `PRD.md`, `implementation.md`, `ui_ux.md`, and `bug_tracking.md`.
- Format all generated Markdown files using clear **headings**, **bullet points**, and a **concise, consistent tone**.
- Avoid duplicating information already documented; focus on minimal, working, testable output.
- Before writing any code file, confirm the feature requirements from the relevant docs (ask questions if unclear).
- When changes affect multiple parts (e.g. adding a filter), coordinate updates across code and docs.
- Use checkpoints (restore points) after each major feature is implemented, to allow rollback if needed.
