# Project Workflow Rule

This document outlines the overall coding workflow that this agent should follow for project development.

1. **Initialize Project**
   - Set up the project using a suitable framework (e.g., Create React App, Vite).
   - Initialize a Git repository and establish the initial file structure.

2. **Write PRD (Product Requirements Document)**
   - Document all product requirements in `docs/PRD.md`.

3. **Design Structure**
   - Describe the intended project folder and file organization in `docs/project_structure.md`.

4. **Plan UI/UX**
   - Detail the design and layout plans in `docs/ui_ux.md`.

5. **Implement Code**
   - Develop the main application code (e.g., React components such as `App.js`).
   - Ensure required functionality and apply basic styling.

6. **Document Implementation**
   - Explain the code structure and logic in `docs/implementation.md`.

7. **Testing & Bug Tracking**
   - Outline testing procedures and bug tracking methods in `docs/bug_tracking.md`.

8. **Run & Refine**
   - Start the development server, perform manual testing, and iteratively improve the application based on feedback and findings.
