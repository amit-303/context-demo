# Code Review Feedback: React To-Do Application

### Key Findings from the Code Review

**Overall Assessment:** ⚠️ Needs Improvement

#### Critical Issues
- **Edit Form Duplication:** Both `App.js` and `TodoItem.js` render edit forms, causing test failures and confusing UX.
- **Excessive Prop Drilling:** Too many props are passed for edit functionality.
- **Filter Count Logic Bug:** Task count does not update correctly when filtering.
- **Inconsistent Styling:** Mix of inline styles and CSS classes.

#### Recommendations
- Remove the edit form from `App.js` and keep it only in `TodoItem.js`.
- Refactor edit state management (consider a custom hook or React Context).
- Update the task count logic to reflect filtered results.
- Standardize styling by moving inline styles to CSS classes.
- Fix failing tests related to edit form duplication and filter count.

#### Strengths
- Core features are implemented and functional.
- Good use of React best practices and localStorage with error handling.
- Accessibility and responsive design are present.

#### Action Items
- **Immediate:** Fix edit form duplication, filter count logic, and update failing tests.
- **Short Term:** Refactor edit state, reduce prop drilling, standardize styling.
- **Long Term:** Add error boundaries, performance optimizations, and documentation.
