# Implementation Guide: React To-Do App

## 1. Technical Approach

- **Framework:** React (functional components, hooks)
- **State Management:** useState and useReducer for local state; context if global state is needed
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage for saving tasks between sessions (no backend)
- **Styling:** CSS Modules or styled-components for scoped, maintainable styles
- **Responsiveness:** CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

## 2. **Main Components:**  
- `App.js`: Holds the main state (task list) and functions for adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks. Renders the input form, filter buttons, and the `<TodoList />` component.  
- `TodoList.js`: Receives a list of tasks and renders each `<TodoItem />`. Applies filtering (All/Active/Completed) before display.  
- `TodoItem.js`: Represents one task with a checkbox (to toggle completion), task text, and a delete button. Calls passed-in props functions when toggled or deleted.

## 3. **State Management:**  
- The task list is stored in a state variable (`useState`) in `App.js`. Each task is an object `{ id, text, completed }`.
- Filtering state (`showStatus`) is also kept in `App.js` (e.g. “all”, “active”, or “completed”).  
- When tasks change (add/edit/toggle/delete), `App.js` updates the state and saves the updated list to **`localStorage`**.  

## 4. **Local Storage:**  
- On app load (`useEffect` in `App.js`), we read from `localStorage` (if present) and initialize the state.  
- Whenever the task list state changes, we write the new list to `localStorage` so that data persists.  

## 5. **Components:**
  - `App.js`: Main component holding the state and handlers. It renders the header, `NewTaskForm`, and `TodoList`.
  - `NewTaskForm.js`: A controlled component with an input and Add button. Calls a prop `onAdd(taskText)` when a new task is submitted.
  - `TodoList.js`: Renders a list of tasks. It maps tasks to `TodoItem` components.
  - `TodoItem.js`: Displays a single task with a checkbox and delete button. Calls props `onToggle(id)` and `onDelete(id)` on actions.

## 6. Testing & Quality
- **Unit Tests:** Basic automated tests using Jest for core logic (reducers, helpers) and key components (`App`, `TodoList`, `TodoItem`).
- **Component Tests:** Using React Testing Library to verify UI rendering and user interactions.


Overall, the code follows standard React best practices: state lifting (state in `App.js`), prop drilling to child components, and effect hooks for side effects (like saving to storage). Comments in the code explain key parts for clarity.
